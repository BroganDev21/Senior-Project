"	Going into what I was going to be writing about was somewhat easy. I knew how I had experienced a certain phenomenon and wanted to explore, to see how and why it was so impactful for me. Of course, you know that phenomena I experienced to be dorm isolation and depression. So, deciding my topic, to me, was a no brainer. However slowly narrowing my focus has proven to be a challenge as Its hard to draw specific research from focused points on this topic. Rather I’ve discovered research from around the U.S. and outside the states about many students experiencing the same thing I did. 

	It was very nice to get to talk to you to learn where I can focus my time and research. More so, what to focus on, where to look, and the original ideas you gave me have certainly helped in narrowing the search. Also, discovering ideas from using sources other than journals has been a large help for me. Normally, in my mind, research comes solely from published academic articles or well renowned news organizations, but looking into video media or photos that relate to my topic has allowed me to grasp a new realization for my topic. All the different types of media I have looked at have really assisted me in making my driving points and to keep my focus on what to write.

	Now in terms of the actual conference, I felt like while I certainly could have come a little more detailed in my pitch for what I was researching I enjoyed that you came from a place of understanding and I really felt the encouragement to research this topic. Certainly, I can say that the conference assisted me on my research in more ways than one. And I am looking forward to further conversations about my topic in the future.

"Everyone who has watched NCAA Division I March Madness for either men’s or women’s basketball knows 64 teams are put into a bracket based on seeding. The top four teams are 1 seeds, the next four are two seeds and so on. The teams seeded 1-16 are placed in one of four regions label as either East, West, South or Midwest but is not impacted by the location of the school. For example, Miami played in the Midwest region, Princeton competed in the South region, Arkansas competed in the West, and USC played in the East region during the 2023 March Madness. What if I told you in NCAA Division II and Division III, the playoff bracket is completely different than any other level of the NCAA and is based on where a team is located geographically. Unless you watch no Division I sports or worked in the two divisions, you have probably never heard of playoff regionalization. It’s time to break down what is playoff regionalization, how it is different from Division I and the positives and negatives of the system. Hopefully by the end, a solution will emerge for the issue of playoff regionalization.

	In order to understand how playoff regionalization is vastly different than other levels of the NCAA, knowing the championship setup for Division I is necessary. Let’s start with football since it’s the simplest. A selection committee evaluates every team and determines the top four college football programs in the nation based a multitude of criterion. The top seed plays the bottom seed and the No. 2 seed plays the No. 3 seed for the National Championship. Now shifting to the men’s and women’s March Madness brackets. Again, a committee selects the 36 at-large teams as the rest of the teams automatically qualify as conference champions to make up a 68-team pool. The committee is looking to fill those at-large bids with the best teams in the nation. Once the 68 teams are determined, the committee creates a “seed list,” which is ranking the teams one through 68. Taking into account many aspects like fairness, strength of the regions, conferences, etc., the committee seeds the regions from then “seed list”. Geography is not included as a consideration in seeding, in fact the intentionally make it where teams from the same conference don’t play each other until at least the sweet 16. All the other sports are similar in that conference champions automatically qualify but the selection of the at-large bids is simply filling out the rest of the bracket by a committee.

	Playoff regionalization is the process the NCAA uses to pool teams together that will square off in the postseason (Missourian). The process involves separating teams into specific regions of the country. Atlantic, Central, East, Midwest, South, South Central, Southeast, and West are the eight regions. The Atlantic region includes: Maryland and most of West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina; Central consists of North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas and a little bit of South Dakota, Nebraska, Missouri Oklahoma and Arkansas; East extends over Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and little of Pennsylvania;  Midwest spreads over Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and small parts of Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri; South factors in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and the outer edges of Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Kentucky; South Central includes Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado and parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota; Southeast spreads over most of Florida and Georgia and a little of Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina; West consists of Alaska, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Oregon, Nevada, California, and Arizona. All but one of which contain three of the 23 Division II conferences. A team needs to rank in the top eight in most sports with the only exception of football where it's the top seven that advance which is determined by their region record (wins and losses against teams in the same region). After those teams are selected, the compete against each other a three round regional bracket hosted by the No. 1 seed. Only the eight regional champions advance to the NCAA Championships at the predetermined location. Also, the eight regional champions are reseeded one through eight. In this regional system, the regional poll is what matters not the national poll. If you were to go to the NCAA website, you can see that Division II and Division III sports include a region ranking drop down in the rankings tab while Division I does not include this option.

	Even though the Division II playoff format is different than the Division I format, playoff regionalization does present positives for schools in the division. Since the playoff bracket is made up of regions intends for schools in every region of the country have access and a chance at a NCAA championship. There are plenty of fans and schools that complain about the College Football Playoff system because there are only four teams with a chance at a title. That’s why so many have argued for a large playoff bracket and even then, only 12 teams will get a shot at a ring. Football is not the only example, in every Division I there is a region that is not represented. The 2023 NCAA Women’s Soccer Championships only eight schools are located west of Texas and five of those schools are in California. Now the 2023 NCAA Volleyball Championships has more representation around the country but still the southwest had zero schools compete. However, if you look at the Division II NCAA Women’s Soccer Championships bracket you also see locations not represented like the southwest and north. 

	The main reason for playoff regionalization was to encourage schools to compete against opponents within their geographical regions. The NCAA incentivizes scheduling regional opponents because it helps schools manage travel budgets and limit missed class time for student-athletes. Lower NCAA divisions make less money in broadcast rights and advertising than Division I schools. Most of the generated revenues for Division II schools come from ticket sales, donors, camps and NCAA and conference distributions. On average, Division II schools have more expenses than revenue gained (NCAA Research). In 2019, none of the 310 schools surveyed by the NCAA had generated revenues exceeding their expenses. Plenty of school have drop sports due to lack of funds. Most recently St. Leo University announced the discontinuing of its men’s and women’s track, men’s and women’s cross country and men’s and women’s swimming teams at the end of the Spring 2023 semester. By the end of the 2022-23 sports season, St. Leo will not be the only school to cut sports. So, the NCAA tries to help by prioritizing regional match-ups to save costs. Teams traveling across country can get expensive with flight costs increasing. If teams decide to bus instead of flying that takes students away from school and class longer. The NCAA appears to want to save schools money and do what is best for the student-athlete. 

	While regionalization benefits the universities in a couple ways it misses the mark in other ways and less enjoyable for fans. The system is supposed to allow for representation across the United States in the playoff but as mentioned before this is still not always the case.  Not only does it not always allow everyone a chance at a championship title, the Division I playoff format does a great job of representing the whole country without playing within the region. For example,

"	This study was created to assess developmental differences of gifted children versus average children. The main goal was in order to highlight observations the parents of gifted children have notices in their gifted child. For this study, face to face interviews were carried out with the parents of 112 children identified as gifted. The result of the process was that gifted children display different characteristics in cognitive, linguistic, affective and psychomotor skills in comparison with average children. The article starts with an introduction to the premise of the studies which are taking place and the data presented within them. Beginning with a study conducted by Hall and Skinner in 1980 these researchers found that gifted children develop thirty percent faster in comparison with the normal population of children in the 0-6 ager range. Many of the studies taken showed interesting data in regards to a gifted child’s infant stage development. Gifted children often were able to sit, stand, crawl, and walk on their own significantly sooner than their average counterparts. And as their linguistic abilities were more developed due to their cognitive advantage over average children the same age, their curiosity became a large factor in providing evidence as to if a child may be gifted or not. Furthermore, gifted children’s enhanced memory allowed them to learn more quickly in regards to mathematics, problem solving, and remembering more detail. The article continues to provide evidence of these traits becoming prevalent through a series of studies conducted over a span of around twenty years. Each of these studies reinforcing the already set precedent in which gifted children show increased cognitive ability in which they can use to solve more advanced math, and solve more complex problems than that of the average child in their age range. The article continues to discuss what kinds of games gifted children and their average counterparts enjoy. Studies from Foster a researched who conducted their study in 1993 concluded gifted children appear to be just as interested in activities their average counterparts carry out, however, they enjoy a greater depth and more detail of the games ort activities they seem to be carrying out. Many researchers who participated in the research gathered state it is very important that parents of gifted children attempt to identify these traits so that those children are able to get the attention needed to expand their cognitive abilities to continue continued growth and eventually apply themselves better in the future. The article continues, Families having knowledge of the development of their children has a positive impact not only on the gifted children, but on all children. It goes on in to detail an important study conducted. A study of gifted children during the preschool period in Turkey. While there are a limited number of studies on gifted children during the preschool period in turkey the findings found that teachers have a greater ability in assessing a child’s cognitive abilities far greater than that of a family’s abilities to do the same. The article continues to describe the formalities of the study presented. The method of the study was designed as a case study from quantitative research patterns. And families who observe gifted children from birth were selected since they are the individuals who experience the cognitive advantages. The sample of the study was comprised of the parents of 112 children diagnosed as gifted at the Izmir Sidika Science and Art Center. Through these studies it was apparent that gifted children’s perception was 30% higher than that of an average child in their age category with each other test fewer than the last. Allowing researchers to determine that the abilities of a gifted child stem from being aware of problems and tasks much greater than that of its counterparts. The article completes with a summary of the data presented and presents the implications that this study could be beneficial for designing more studies in the future with the knowledge gained. Finally, the article concludes with the next steps in which the research could continue and; possible studies which have yet to be made.

"	It is fair to say, the African American population of the English colonies suffered numerous atrocities, violations, and degradations throughout the life span of colonial life. However, to many it is unknown that African American slaves weren’t the only non-free people throughout the colonies who were degraded and treated with such indignity that the aftershock is still felt through the United States today. Indentured servants of Irish, English, and other European descent as well as Native American captives were confronted with many of the same inhumane conditions that African American slaves were exposed to in the tumultuous time period. African American slaves and indentured servants alike were stripped of their humanity through various methods such as being treated as a man’s property, being compared to wild animals, and by a lack of material wealth to a point in which starvation was a constant threat.

	To begin, African American slaves and indentured servants both were reduced to a social standing no higher than the goods and property his or her owner had collected. Through numerous runaway advertisements this commonality can be clearly seen. “A common feature of colonial newspapers from Massachusetts to Georgia were advertisements for runaway servants and slaves, which numbered in the thousands. The ads could be found among other notices for lost or stolen goods, for debt collections and foreclosures, or for the sale of real estate, servants, slaves, or animals.” (Colonial America’s Most Wanted). The primary source clearly references both slaves and servants alike not only attempting to flee their inhumane bondage which asserts a degree to assume their conditions in their captivity was more alike than previously assumed. But this evidence also demonstrates slaves and servants were degraded to the point of no longer being recognized as a human being by their holders. They were reduced to a product, a good which had been misplaced. Not only were slaves and indentured servants reduced to be nothing more than a trade good to the English colonists. They also endured the same grueling physical labor and hefty punishments provided to them by their English owners.

	While indentured servants and African American slaves eventually were separated into two groups due to growing racial prejudice. In the beginning they were both subjected to the same rigorous work detail and harsh punishments. “Black slaves and white servants toiled in the swamps of Georgia, in the tobacco fields of Virginia, in the iron shops of Pennsylvania, and in the homes and on the docks of Boston. Both called their bosses “master” and endured whippings as the most common form of discipline.” (Colonial America’s Most Wanted). In this time, slaves and servants were not so distinguishable, they could be white, black, Indian, or another nationality and yet their work was the same body breaking toil and their punishments severe. Servants were allowed to be punished like slaves to the fact where the grand assembly of Virginia enacted a law which allowed servants to be punished after running away. “It is declared and enacted by this Assembly that moderate corporal punishment inflicted by master or magistrate upon a runaway servant shall not derivate the master of the satisfaction allowed by the law.” (Virginia Slave Laws). While the work and punishments for both parties involved were severe, the English employed other tactics of ensuring their slaves and servants alike maintained the mindset that they were subhuman. 

	To expand upon the English colonial mindset, they intended to present slaves and servants as something that was below human. Likening them to animals this was another tactic to influence others to see slaves and servants as such. As well as instill the mindset to the slaves and servants that they were subhuman. “And forasmuch as the said negroes and other slaves brought unto the people of this province for that purpose, are of barbarous, wild, savage natures.” (Slavery and Prejudice). This provides a foundation that slaves and servants alike were reduced to nothing but wild animals in the mind of the colonists. These claims that servants and slaves were wild animals only draws the fact closer that slaves and servants were not treated as differently as so many people have come to believe so. The article continues of the temperaments and natural inclinations of slaves and servants. “…should in this Providence be made and enacted, for the good regulating and ordering of them, as may restrain the disorders, rapines, and inhumanity, to which they are naturally prone and inclined.” (Slavery and Prejudice).  Clearly through the evidence provided slaves and servants alike were likened to animals. However, these similarities span to their material wealth they were able to accrue, if any at all.

	An indentured servant’s letter to his father describes the conditions in which his indentured servitude forced him into. “For since I came out of the ship, I never ate anything but peas, and loblollie. As for deer or venison I never saw any since I came into this land.” (Richard Frethorne). These were the conditions for all slaves or servants. While many stole from one another to stay alive they faced starvation and death on a daily basis. Hunger and starvation weren’t all that they faced. The slaves and servants alike had no decent clothes to keep them warm or decent homes in which they could brave the cruel conditions of the colonies after a long day in their respective labor roles. “I have nothing at all- no, not a shirt to my back but two rags, nor but one pair of shoes… but one cap.” (Richard Frethorne). These were the economic conditions for all servants and some slaves. Albeit, these conditions gradually degraded for slaves of an African American descent these harsh conditions were what slaves and servants alike experienced when they first arrived in the colonies.

	It’s always difficult to determine whether one man’s plight is worse than another’s. However, brought forth by the evidence it is fair to say that slaves and servants both shared many similarities in terms of how they were treated, punished, and lived in the English colonies. Through these documents presented and the evidence provided servants and slaves lived more similar than different throughout their time in the English colonies. While there were vast differences between the two many of their experiences shared multiple commonalities.

"	Green spaces have been a growing interest in today’s climate of working conditional changes. Many companies have adopted new working environments which include ample greenspace to maximize efficiency in their own employees. Algorithmically speaking, the greatest way to amplify an employees’ output is to ensure that an employee is working in conditions that promote the most growth in the most effective manner.  “Bodies Situated in a Natural World” by Sarah Williams Goldhagen and “A Typology of Places in the Knowledge Economy: Towards the Fourth Place” from Arnoult Morrison both rely on the key ideology that an improvement in social living structure and change in the working environment promotes growth and mutual health between not only employee, but employer.

	To begin, the most commonly shared ideology between the two readings. The inclusion of green spaces only improves upon workflow balance, healthy practices, and an increase in work productivity. Goldhagen delves into detail on the many beneficial gains from introducing more green spaces into the modern-day working world. Citing that not only does the creation of more natural looking landscape, architecture, and green scape influence a more productive work environment but also improves upon employee’s quality of life. Morrison exemplifies this fact, when discussing the many changes modern installations take in ensuring a happy work life balance. Morrison ensures to include, when talking about the many changes new companies have taken to ensuring employee productivity, that greenspaces have been installed in all of the modern third and fourth places that have been developed. The inclusion of greenspaces allows us to return to our roots in a sense. However, not to turn to animality, and savagery. However, t turn to true innovation which is what allowed our species to survive in the beginning before modern urban cityscapes and developments truly took hold. Green space brings everyone who views it into that primal sense of place. A remembrance of where we came from, and promotes the primal urges human beings have. We are innovators, destined to improve due to our surroundings.

	Goldenhagen plants her feet firmly in the ground on this belief. Humans will always be innovators. Destined and driven by an almost primal urge to improve, develop, and innovate upon our given surrounding. This is shown in full from studies gathered in which display he benefit from green spaces. Green spaces, as displayed from Goldhagen promote sociality, wellbeing, and mental stability. Going as far to prove that those without green spaces suffered severely compared to their counterparts who had access to them. This idea is exclaimed by Morrison in the fact that in certain environments human beings are primed to succeed more than others. Specifically, when allowed to work in conditions which exhibit feelings of security and natural growth. Green spaces are the key factor in allowing us as a race to exude our innovative predilections. Both Morrison and Goldhagen argue that we as a race must not forget our past, which will continue to see us turn to a dystopian future full of synthetic material, rather they would rather see us blossom with natural arenas in which we are able to give our full attention and focus.",Synthesis,English Synthesis,23,62,0,525,26,5.268571428571429,3,0.5638095238095238,Synthesis 2.docx,Human
"Things To Talk About Before Marriage

	Marriage is a major milestone in everyone’s life. It requires planning, a great deal of effort, and strong communication skills. There are a few things couples need to discuss before they get married. The major three points are the financial situations for both people, if the unpaid work around the house will be done by both you and your partner or your children, and how each of you will relate to your own relatives and your partner’s relatives. Additional points to discuss include if you and your partner want to have children, what are the overall educational goals of both you and your partner as well as your children, what are you and your partner’s attitude toward friendships with people of the opposite sex, how much time alone do you and your partner need apart, and how much time do you need with your partner together. Having these answers before marriage will save you and your partner a lot of trouble and will help with communication.

	The financial situation of both you and your partner is a very important thing to know going into marriage. Knowing how to budget and manage not only your money but also your partner’s money will serve as one of the major checks and balances within marriage. Another important conversation to have is who will do most of the unpaid work around the house. The solution to this problem could be whoever is not working will be the stay-at-home parent. Their job will be to ensure the house stays clean and they do most of the basic chores around the house. On the other hand, if both you and your partner work then both of you will work on it.

	The last major point to discuss before marriage is how will you and your partner relate to your own and your partner’s relatives. This is a very important thing to consider around the holiday seasons. This conversation will sort out which side of the family gets each holiday. Another conversation to have is if you and your partner plan to have children. This is very important and could be a deal breaker if both parties do not agree with each other. This question should be one of the first to be discussed.

	Two other important questions to bring up are the educational goals of both you and your partner and what your attitudes are towards friendships with people of the opposite sex. The educational goals aligns with the question about the financial situation of both you and your partner. If you or your partner plan to go to college this could require some extra funds. And this question could be asked to see if you and your partner plan to send your kids to college. Another important question to ask is how you and your partner views friendships with people of the opposite sex. This is a great question to ask as it will provide clarity on how you and your partner view this situation. But if your viewpoint doesn’t align with your partners this could cause some trouble later in the marriage. 

	The final two questions to ask are how much alone time do you need for yourself, and how much alone time do you need with your partner. Maintaining a balance between your marriage, work, and your mental health is something most people have trouble with. So having this additional alone time to yourself could help you align these three major things in your life. Likewise asking the question for how much alone time do you and your partner need could help situate any problems that could arise. This could be used to continue your emotional and physical connection to your partner, or it could be to help each other with their work-life issues.",Briggs,Essay,13,62,0,637,30,4.624803767660911,6,0.37205651491365777,Things to Discuss before Marriage.docx,Human
"	The narrator I believe is giving the feeling and perspective of a friend to Cletus. While the narrator does seem to take different stands, he does recount how he failed to support Cletus a friend from school and son of a murderer. While I do want to take the position of a judge in these situations because the narrator can be slightly ambiguous in which he attacks the story of Cletus and the ways they interact, however the narrator has had tragedies of their own happen allowing them to sympathize with Cletus. While the two may have been friends, the narrator still stands his own ground in being an impartial character reminiscing nothing more, like thinking back to a long-lost friend many you do miss but as time moves forward after losing contact with those you lose your judgement of those characters and see them in a more linear fashion instead of with the dynamic lens a friendship would provide. This story to me is not linear, while it does have a beginning middle and an end it doesn’t weave them in perfectly to where you can always tell this is the beginning, middle, etc. The story does skip and jump a few places however it keeps the story of the narrator and Cletus’ friendship bound together. I believe the narrator is unreliable. While he does give off the fact that he did know Cletus, the narrator says they didn’t acknowledge him in the hallways, to me this is a big point, because if the narrator doesn’t notice Cletus, then how can he be reliable to inform us of all the events and if the narrator can be trusted with all the information given. This may be a stretch but could the old age of the narrator happen to affect him and influence how much they may remember about Cletus; it was a long time ago.

"	On the subject of technology and how it seems to complicate todays modern climate it definitely can be said that it makes waves and skews the truth. Not to where the truth isn’t there, but that the truth is harder to find. For example, in modern times like ours today I hate to touch on this because of politics but the term “Fake News” comes to mind. In today’s world there’s so many media and journalism outlets some preaching the truth others preaching fallacies and everything else in between it can be out right staggering to wade through this mess of information. So, I definitely think the narrator is correct in assuming that technology can be skewing many truths of the time. Just like in our time, although we are much more technologically advanced, we have many different opinions of people’s truths that get aired on the news, in newspapers, and through our phones that make it difficult to tell what the truth may actually be. Also even influencing our own truth. What he could mean by daily seeping false hearted death is that the news which is coming out daily is slowly sending information to us in which we don’t know is true, we haven’t seen it we are relying on others who maybe have different opinions than our own. The death comes into quite literally the death of the truth, being it becomes so skewed that no one knows what is really true because nothing can be trusted. This causes many sources to become unreliable and blurs the lines of what can and can’t be trusted. This might be an odd take but I do think it fits the quote as to what the author was saying in regards to what technology can do to our minds and opinions.",Synthesis 3,Technology,9,27,0,301,11,4.48172757475083,1,0.584717607973422,Weekly Writing 3.docx,Human
"	Jack and Murrays conversation about takes a few interesting directions. What most prominently speaks out to me is this bit “Your status as a doomed man lends your words a certain prestige and authority. I like that. As the time nears, I think you’ll find that people will be eager to hear what you have to say. They will seek you out.” Murray says this to Jack giving me the impression that either he doesn’t fully understand death and what it means to have it literally waiting for you in the next years, or he doesn’t see death as a negative at all, meanwhile Jack is terrified of death, he really doesn’t want to die and you can tell by his diction and the way he words everything. Murray is defending death arguing it’s not the worst thing, you will be sought out, people will listen to you. This is an oddly optimistic look into the idea of death. 

	Another interesting point the two make is farther in the conversation they happen upon the topic of is life incomplete without death. “No. There is no reason to believe life is more precious because it is fleeting. Here is a statement. A person has to be told he is going to die before he can begin to live life to the fullest. True or False?” Jack replies “False. Once your death is established, it becomes impossible to live a satisfying life”. Both make great points, no one would truly live if you weren’t going to die at some point, there wouldn’t be an end you’d just live an existence it’d have meaning but nowhere near as much meaning as a life with a time period to fulfill desires and achieve goals! However, Jack says once you know you’re going to die there isn’t enough things to do or accomplish in the world which would satisfy you. This comes from Jacks pure desire to continue living, spoken true of a man who was given a death sentence and can’t avoid it.

	These characters want to find the truth to this topic because it is the meaning of life! Everyone wants to find the truth to this topic; Jack would like to find it faster than he will because death is approaching closer for him and it’s much more of a real idea than a thought in his mind that it may happen one day. 

	The truth is less cut and dry I believe because everyone has their own truths, dictated through complex motivations, beliefs, and upbringings. You can’t tell someone their truth isn’t true because it is what they believe. Especially in an argument such as what is the purpose of death and the meaning of life. This as one of life’s essential yet unsolvable question truly depends on individual beliefs to find what your own personal belief is.

"Chemical process safety is a subfield of applied engineering that is concerned with locating and reducing potential risks connected to chemical processing. Chemical factories, refineries, and other facilities that handle hazardous materials depend on this field to operate safely and effectively. Chemical process safety is used to avoid and reduce mishaps, incidents, and harm that could happen while handling, storing, and processing chemicals. Engineering controls, safe work practices, and emergency response planning are used in tandem to achieve this. If any of these procedures are not followed, an incident can occur.

The creation and use of efficient hazard identification and risk assessment methodologies is one of the essential elements of chemical process safety. These methods aid in determining potential risks connected to chemical processing processes as well as their likelihood and possible effects.

The Texas city incident was an explosion that caused the lives of 15 workers and at least 170 more being injured. This incident is one of the deadliest in the United States. The explosion occurred in a unit of the refinery that was being restarted after a scheduled shutdown for maintenance purposes. For the restart procedure, a large amount of flammable liquids was being directed into one of the distillation towers. But during this event the system malfunction causing the flammable liquid to be sent to a blowdown drum instead. This caused it to be heated and vaporized. The pressure started to build up in this drum until the drum ruptured releasing all the chemicals stored. This cloud of hydrocarbons ignited and caused an explosion. This explosion caused widespread damage to the refinery with several buildings getting destroyed in the process. This incident took weeks to get under control.

	There was no one root cause to this incident, but one of the major factors that led to it was safety agencies prioritizing personal safety over process safety. With one of the leading causes for workplace accidents is slips, trips, and falls. But by putting all focus and resources into stopping this issue, that leads to little to no deaths per year, process safety is almost always overlooked. This is a big concern and could lead to major process incidents, like the one that happened in Texas City. But some of the factors that did contribute to this incident were improper training, improper safety measures, and improper equipment maintenance.

The History of Greece: A Tapestry of Civilization

The history of Greece is a mosaic of cultural achievements, conflicts, and transformations that have profoundly influenced Western civilization. From the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations through the classical age of Athens and Sparta, to the Hellenistic period following Alexander the Great's conquests, and finally to the Byzantine era, Greece has been a crucible of political, philosophical, and artistic development. This essay explores the rich tapestry of Greek history, highlighting the key periods and their contributions to the broader narrative of human progress.

The dawn of Greek history is marked by the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete (circa 2600-1400 BCE), known for its sophisticated architecture, vibrant frescoes, and the legendary palace of Knossos. The Minoans established far-reaching trade networks and developed a script known as Linear A, which remains undeciphered. The Mycenaean civilization (circa 1600-1100 BCE), centered on the Greek mainland, is renowned for its imposing fortresses, gold-laden tombs, and the epic tales of Homer that recount the Mycenaean exploits during the Trojan War.

Following the mysterious collapse of the Mycenaean civilization, Greece entered a 'Dark Age' (circa 1100-800 BCE), during which writing was lost, and society regressed. The end of this period saw the rise of the polis or city-state, marking the beginning of the Archaic Period (circa 800-500 BCE). This era witnessed the emergence of democracy in Athens, the codification of laws by figures like Draco and Solon, and the early inklings of philosophical thought.

The Classical Period (circa 500-323 BCE) represents the zenith of Greek cultural and political achievement. The Persian Wars (490-479 BCE) unified the Greek city-states under Athenian leadership, culminating in the victories at Marathon, Salamis, and Plataea. The subsequent Golden Age of Athens, led by Pericles, fostered unprecedented advancements in philosophy, arts, and sciences. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle laid the foundations of Western philosophy, while dramatists such as Sophocles and Euripides explored the depths of the human condition. However, the Peloponnesian War (431-404 BCE) between Athens and Sparta marked the decline of Athenian dominance, revealing the inherent fragility of the Greek city-state system.

The conquests of Alexander the Great (336-323 BCE) ushered in the Hellenistic Period (323-31 BCE), spreading Greek culture across the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East.
